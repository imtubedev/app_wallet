This project uses `create-react-app` to scaffold the application.  You can clone the project from github and
use the usual commands to start the application locally. Once cloned, cd into the project directory and run
the following to start the application.

$ yarn start
```

To build and run this styleguide locally, use the following:

If you make changes to the `styleguide.config.js` file in the root repository or modify any of the custom
styleguide components, be sure and restart the styleguide to see the changes.
