This styleguide is intended for designers and developers to be a living document of
the specific branding, styles, components and patterns used through out the project.
This styleguide is generated from source files and from static documentation files
found in the `docs/` folder at the top level of the project root.

We're using [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) for generating 
this styleguide automatically from source.  Each component or set of related 
components will have it's own section within the styleguide. You can read the docs
for the React Styleguidist project for more details.
